# ðŸ›’ Online Retail Application Database

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This SQL project models the core backend of an online retail platform. It simulates how customers, employees, and products interact within a transactional ecosystem. The schema is designed to demonstrate real-world business logic for e-commerce operations, covering user management, order processing, product inventory, payment tracking, and delivery workflows.
